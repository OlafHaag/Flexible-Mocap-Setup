#Mocap Character Setup##Python Script for Motionbuilder This is my first attempt to write a python script for Motionbuilder.###AboutIts main purpose is to generate a skeleton that fits into recorded marker data by estimating the joints' positions. Ideally it should be able to deliver a one-click solution for setting up a character that fits recorded data and be used in subsequent live sessions with the same performer.The motivation behind it is, that current workflows of setting up a character for a virtual reality live session demand a high level of expertise, don't work well and simply are too time consuming.###UsageJust drag script into the MotionBuilder view and execute.*This script is part of a research project at the Philipps-University Marburg.*
